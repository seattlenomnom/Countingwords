/* README for countingwords
*     Create a large buffer of characters from the console, then count the
*  number of words in the character buffer.
*
*  An example program from Kochan, Stephen G., "Programming in C 3rd ed.",
*  Sams Publishing.
*
*  Programmer: Mark Crapser
*
*
*  const char string[] vs. char string[] ... what is the difference?
*  I create a variable lenght string and pass it to countwords() which is
*  expecting a const char string[]. What is going on?
*

*     "Finished" countingwords example, now proceding with problem 3 on page
*  230.
* Problem 1: lamb's is two words.
* Solution 1: in isAlphabetic added (c== '\'').
*
* problem 2: handling numbers (and their commas and periods)
* solution2: modded isalphabetic to look for special characters. added
* isspecialchar function. isspecialchar function looks for numbers(and ass-
* ociated commas and periods), and single apostrophes. next might implement
* isspecial character with a switch to clean upt the logic. if i do that, i
* should creat a git branch to experiment then merge the branch to main.
